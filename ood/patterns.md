Behavioral design patterns are concerned with communication between objects. They focus on how objects interact and distribute responsibilities. Here are the types of behavioral design patterns:

- Chain of Responsibility Pattern: This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of a request based on the type of request. It passes the request along a chain of potential receivers until it is handled.

- Command Pattern: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

- Interpreter Pattern: This pattern provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression.

- Iterator Pattern: This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

- Mediator Pattern: This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

- Memento Pattern: This pattern captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

- Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- State Pattern: This pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

- Strategy Pattern: This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Template Method Pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.

- Visitor Pattern: This pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
