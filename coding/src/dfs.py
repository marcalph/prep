# examples 
# Find products in a price range: convert prices in BST then variation of preorder traversal
# Dependency resolution: In the dependency graph as DFS traverses the graph, it naturally produces a topological ordering of the nodes.
# Syntax tree analysis: In compilers and interpreters, source code is typically represented as syntax trees. dfs can be used to perform tasks code generation, optimization, or static analysis
